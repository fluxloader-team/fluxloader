# v2.0.0 Design Notes

## Notes / TODO

Mod load order saving somehow  

- If mods are added / removed between runs of the modloader this needs updating  
- Probably should use the modloader-config.json  

We need to be able to have the mods ran alongside the game  

- The mods needs access to a browser modloaderAPI  
- The browser modloaderAPI needs to be triggering events  

This needs need some JS running alongside the game  

Modloader window site and IPC

System for mods to communicate back and forth between browser / electron if needed
