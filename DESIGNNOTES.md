# v2.0.0 Design Notes

## Notes / TODO

Mod load order saving somehow  

- If mods are added / removed between runs of the modloader this needs updating  
- Probably should use the modloader-config.json  

We need to be able to have the mods ran alongside the game inside some JS

- The mods needs access to a browser modloaderAPI  
- The browser modloaderAPI needs to be triggering events  

Modloader window site and IPC
