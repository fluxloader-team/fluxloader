# Sandustry Modloader

## TODO

### Small changes

- Better error message on missing file for patches / other (see electrics message)
- Check that regex patches work with capture groups as expected (and naming scheme is good)
- Look over `fileManager` access through the `ElectronModloaderAPI`

### Primary Requirements

- Install / uninstall mods
- Integrate mod config GUI
- Mod info config GUI
- Modloader config GUI
- Forward game console to electron (config to enable)
- Forward electron and game console to GUI
